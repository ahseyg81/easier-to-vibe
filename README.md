# easier-to-vibe

"Tired of breaking your coding flow just to copy-paste AI snippets?"

**easier-to-vibe** is a frictionless, browser-based code playground. It instantly turns multi-file AI code snippets into running applications. No setup, no terminal mess—just pure coding vibe.

## Why We Built This

When you ask an AI for code, you often get a massive block containing `main.py`, `utils.py`, and `styles.css`. Manually creating these files is the ultimate flow killer.

**We fix this:**

* Paste the whole chat/code block.
* We auto-parse it into a virtual file system.
* Run Python, C/C++, or Web projects instantly in your browser.

## Cool Features

* ** Smart Parsing:** Recognizes the `//--- filename.ext ---` syntax (the same one your AI assistant uses!) and splits files automatically.
* ** Polyglot Power:** Renders HTML/CSS/JS in a live preview. Runs Python and C/C++ using the Piston API.
* ** magic-inputs™:** Automatically detects `input()` or `// input("Label")` and generates friendly UI input boxes. Say goodbye to raw console interaction!
* ** Quick Export:** Download your entire project as a `.zip` file with one click.
* ** Dark Mode by Default:** Because bugs fear the dark.

##  How to Vibe

1.  Open the **Live Editor**.
2.  Paste your multi-file code block.
3.  Click **"Parse Project"** (Projeyi Ayrıştır).
4.  Click **"Run"** (Çalıştır).
5.  Enjoy the output in the console or preview window!
